# CaseStudy2_ATM

The java project is based on Case Study 2 which is working of an ATM machine.It is fairly simple to run after cloning. 
The code is distributed across 3 classes which are Customer,ATM,Bank.
The Bank class is the one from where the code will start to run.
Only thing to note is that the input.txt and output.txt file locations may need to be set according to the local system so that the program is able to locate them while execution.
